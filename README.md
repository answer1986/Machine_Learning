# Machine-Learning-Project
Meng Project August 2019
In this Project we are provided with Data Sets and We need to find accuracy and F1 score with various combination of Dimensionality reduction and Classifier and also finding accuracy without DR methods

In my project I used:
DR methods - LDA , Isomap , Sammon mapping
Classifiers - Random Forest, KNN(k nearest neighbours), MLP(Multilayer perceptron), RBF (Radial Basis Function)
